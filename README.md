## 💼 Highlights - What I have built

- Developed scalable backend services using TypeScript, Node.js, and NestJS, focusing on performance, reliability, and clean architectural boundaries.

- Built modular, secure, production-ready Terraform infrastructure with reusable patterns that support multi-environment consistency and automated provisioning.

- Optimized and maintained PostgreSQL and MongoDB in production, covering schema design, performance tuning, indexing strategy, and operational stability.

- Designed and operated systems across EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, and broader AWS ecosystem services, including scaling policies, cost controls, and uptime improvements.

- Delivered internal tooling, platform APIs, and reusable infra modules that improved developer velocity and reduced onboarding time for product teams.

- Owned the full lifecycle of platform features: architecture, implementation, CI/CD integration, deployment, monitoring, and operational support.

- Led incident response, on-call rotations, and root-cause analysis, ensuring resilient, well-instrumented production environments.

- Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines) with automated testing, gated deployments, environment orchestration, and rollback workflows.

- Operated with a strong DevOps and SRE mindset, prioritizing automation, observability, and system reliability over manual processes.

- Worked effectively in high-ambiguity, fast-moving environments, making sound decisions with available information and delivering high-leverage solutions quickly.

- Experienced with clear technical writing, documentation, and cross-team alignment in distributed remote teams.

- Engaged directly with internal users to understand bottlenecks and design platform-first solutions that improve developer experience and operational efficiency.

- Comfortable working independently with high ownership.
