# 👋 Hey, I'm Kunal Mishra

🚀 **Backend Engineer | Cloud-Native Architect | System Design Enthusiast**  
Building scalable systems, automating cloud infra, and occasionally exploring AI + Blockchain.

## 💼 Summary

I'm a backend engineer passionate about crafting reliable, high-performance systems. I’ve worked across fast-paced startups to enterprise SaaS platforms, focusing on:

- Designing distributed, event-driven architectures
- Building cloud-native APIs using Node.js, TypeScript, and Python
- Scaling serverless apps with AWS Lambda, SQS, SNS, and RDS
- Automating infra using Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines
- Integrating emerging technologies like LLMs and blockchain when it fits the problem

I believe in clean architecture, measurable impact, and writing code that’s easy to reason about—even six months later.
